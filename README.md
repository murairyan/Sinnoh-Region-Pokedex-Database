Me alongside another student worked on a database using MySQL language. Every team was a given a task to create a database of any subject they had most interest in. In my partner and I's case, we decided to do our database on pokemon and more specifically the Sinnoh Region Pokedex (this is generation IV) because we both had a passion for pokemon and we were both familiar with the pokemon from this generation.

 Firstly before even creating the database, we had to create an Entity Relationship (ER) diagram of our intended database with every entity along side its relationships, cardinalities, and its attributes. Afterwards, once the ER diagram felt solid we moved to a Relational Model which just maps out the logic structure of the database, including its relationships and constraints to determine how the data can be accessed and stored. This process also helps point out the primary and foreign keys of the database.

After the conceptual phase of the project was done, it was right into the implementation of the database. We used MySQL WorkBench and it was my first time ever using this language. Although it was confusing at first, the overall process of making the tables, its attributes, the keys, and linking the tables was insightful and fun. Troubleshooting the issues within the code was not too difficult to handle and I was able to work in tiny steps unlike I had done before. I typically work in big steps and that ends up being my greatest demise in terms of coding. Once the tables were created and all the relationship entities established the next step was to create CSV files that would be imported into each table. Since the database is based on pokemon, we had to manually input data into an Excel spreadsheet. There were errors in importing the CSV files, so most troubleshooting had to be done in TextEdit. 

Implementation of the database with PHP and HTML files is rather hard to explain, but it can be seen in the repostitory. Enjoy.
